# Fract-ol

Project from 42 asking you to use a proprietary graphics library to create a program displaying some fractals, written in C. Compiles on linux architectures only.

Usage: ./fract-ol [mandelbrot], [julia [imaginary number] [real number]], [burning_ship]

This version is barebones, and uses only one CPU core for rendering, making it pretty slow. A good improvement would be to implement multithreading, but ain't nobody got time for that.
